# **App Name**: Dual Maze Escape

## Core Features:

- Maze Generation: Generates a random maze layout for players to navigate. Each maze should have a clear start and end point.
- Interactive Maze Display: Displays the generated maze with distinct paths and walls. Includes two player avatars, each controlled separately to navigate the maze.
- Multi-Player Logic: Implements game logic to allow two players to simultaneously navigate the maze, detect collisions with walls, and determine when both players have reached the exit. The game provides feedback on win/loss conditions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark gray (#333) for the maze walls to provide clear visual boundaries.
- Background color: Light gray (#f0f0f0) to contrast with the maze walls and paths.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) to highlight the players and the exit, making them easily distinguishable.
- Clear, top-down view of the maze with equally sized cells for easy navigation. Maintain a fixed aspect ratio to prevent distortion.
- Simple circular avatars for each player, colored differently for easy identification.
