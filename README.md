# 🎮 Dual Maze Escape

**Dual Maze Escape** is a two-player cooperative maze game where players must navigate through a randomly generated maze and reach the exit together. Built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and AI-generated components, it features smooth interaction and potential for bot integration.

The project also includes artificial intelligence with pathfinding algorithms such as **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**, **A\***, and others, enabling the implementation of automated player movement and intelligent decision-making.
